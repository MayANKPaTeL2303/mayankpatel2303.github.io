🛠️ Areas to Improve
1. Add Resume Download Option
The “Resume” button on the sidebar currently isn’t linked in the screenshots — ensure it opens or downloads your latest PDF resume.

2. Make Projects More Actionable
Consider adding:
- Live demo links (if available).

- Brief bullet points (e.g., features implemented, challenges solved).

- Status (e.g., “In Progress”, “Completed”).

3. Mobile Responsiveness
Not visible from the screenshots, but ensure:

The layout stacks correctly on smaller screens.

Buttons and text aren’t too small.

4. Grammar/Content Polish
A few edits to make your text more professional:

“Spearheaded the design and documentation of the Self Serve Feature Panel…” ✅
But also mention a quantifiable impact, if possible (e.g., reduced development time by X%).

“A simple and elegant blogging platform…” — good, but mention if authentication is supported.

5. Contact Form
No “success” or “error” feedback is visible. Ensure that:

On submission, users receive a confirmation.

Backend is connected (using EmailJS, Formspree, or a backend API).

6. Accessibility and SEO
Add:

Proper <title> and <meta> tags.

Alt text for your profile image.

Semantic HTML (<section>, <nav>, etc.).
